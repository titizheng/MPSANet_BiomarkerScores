If you have any quesions, please post it on github issues

 ## Prerequisites
* Python (3.6)
* Numpy (1.14.3)
* Scipy (1.0.1)
* [PyTorch (0.3.1)/CUDA 8.0](https://pytorch.org/previous-versions/) The specific binary wheel file is [cu80/torch-0.3.1-cp36-cp36m-linux_x86_64.whl](http://download.pytorch.org/whl/cu80/torch-0.3.1-cp36-cp36m-linux_x86_64.whl). I havn't tested on other versions, especially 0.4+, wouldn't recommend using other versions.
* torchvision (0.2.0)
* PIL (5.1.0)
* scikit-image (0.13.1)
* [OpenSlide 3.4.1](https://openslide.org/)(Please don't use 3.4.0 as some potential issues found on this version)/[openslide-python (1.1.0)](https://github.com/openslide/openslide-python)
* matplotlib (2.2.2)


## Date
The main data are the whole slide images (WSI) in *.ndpi.Data are available on reasonable request. The Yale 
HER2 cohort dataset was obtained from [SamanFarahmandâ€™s project] (https://wiki.
cancerimagingarchive.net/pages/viewpage.action?pageId=119702524). As the use 
of this dataset is subject to critical review by the hospital, if other researchers require 
this dataset, you can contact the corresponding author of this paper.
